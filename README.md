# Voron 2.4 350 Top Extension

After building my first Voron 2.4 350, I celebrated by planning a full size Predator helmet print, as one does. I realized the filament tube would get pushed down by the top panel towards the end of the print, so I made my own version of a top hat that adds a little over 60 mm in height and repeats the visual style of the skirts. The standard top panel fits in a recess. Four of each part are needed along with the following hardware:

(16) M3 roll-in T-nuts
(16) M3x5x4 threaded inserts
(16) M3 x 10 flat head screws
(16) M3 x 8 flat head screws

Steps:
1. Print four of each part
2. Two threaded inserts go in the left end of each left panel, and two inserts go in the back side of each joiner. 
3. Fasten each set of right and left panels together with a joiner and two M3 x 8 flat head screws.
4. Insert four M3 roll-in T-nuts in the top slot of each top frame rail, then fasten each panel assembly to the frame with four M3 x 10 flat head screws.
5. Screw two M3 x 8 flat head screws into the right end of each panel into the left end of the adjacent panel
