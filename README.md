# Voron 2.4 350 Top Extension

After building my first Voron 2.4 350, I celebrated by setting up a full size Predator helmet print, as one does. I realized the filament tube would get pushed down by the top panel towards the end of the print, so I did what others have done and made a top hat to extend the height.
